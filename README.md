# Soil Moisture Measurement
 Arduino Based Soil Moisture Measurement

## Description:
This project is a part of a Smart Farming Project where soil
moisture level is very important for plant. In this project we use soil moisture
sensor with Arduino Microcontroller and display the percentage of Moisture in a
16X2 LCD Display. In this project we use resistive soil moisture sensor which is
continues read the moisture in soil and transfer this data to Arduino and then
Arduino process the data and output the data with LCD Display.
## Equipment :
1. Arduino Uno
2. Soil Moisture Sensor
3. Jumper wires (generic)
4. Breadboard (generic)
5. 16X2 LCD Display
6. I2C LCD Adapter Module
